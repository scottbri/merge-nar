merge-nar
=========

... is a /bin/sh shell script for CYGWIN environments to merge EMC VNX/CX NAR files into a single NAR archive using naviseccli

* assumes EMC naviseccli.exe installed 
* use to upload more easily into other EMC tools
* make sure not to combine NAR data from both SP's... you'll get duplicated performance stats
